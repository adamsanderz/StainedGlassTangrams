# Stained Glass Tangrams

## An Open Source Game by [GeekyTime](https://www.patreon.com/geekytime)

I built this little Tangrams game as my February 2016 [#1GAM](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) entry.

I published [Stained Glass Tangrams on Itch.io](https://geekytime.itch.io/stained-glass-tangrams), like I do with [all of my games](https://geekytime.itch.io/).

I release my games as open source (when I can) because I want more people to play them, learn from them, and hopefully make use of my code and knowledge in their own games. If you love this idea and want me to create more open source games and gamedev tools, please consider [supporting me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/geekytime). Your support would mean a lot!

## How to Play

The easiest way to play Stained Glass Tangrams is on [Itch.io](https://geekytime.itch.io/stained-glass-tangrams).

If you want to play from source, you _should_ be able to clone this repo and simply open it in Unity 5.3 or higher.

If you have any trouble playing the game in the Unity Editor, please open an issue.

## How to Contribute

I love pull requests! Feel free to fork and submit a PR.

I do review all PRs line-by-line before I'll merge. I don't have a style guide, but check out the other source code before you contribute.

Here are a few things I'll expect from any PRs:

- The game should still work :smile:
- Variable names should be clear but concise
- Classes and functions should be small and "do one thing"
- I'm pretty loose about organization, but maybe don't drop like 50 files in one folder
- Consider the copyright and licensing for any code or assets you contribute

I'll try to add a video describing how to add a puzzle to the game, if there's any interest in that.
